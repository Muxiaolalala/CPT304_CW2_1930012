How to run this website?
This is a part of your project that leverages the Vue.js framework. To successfully set up and use this project, follow the step-by-step instructions below:

1. Prerequisites:
   Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
   a. Node.js - A JavaScript runtime environment. You can download it from the official website (https://nodejs.org/).
   b. npm - Node Package Manager, which should come bundled with your Node.js installation.

2. Global Vue CLI Installation:
   To create, manage, and serve Vue.js projects, you will need the Vue CLI installed globally. Run the following command in your terminal/command prompt:

   ```
   npm install -g @vue/cli
   ```

3. Project Setup:
   a. Clone or download the project from the repository to your local machine.
   b. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal/command prompt.
   c. Install project dependencies using the following command:

      ```
      npm install
      ```

4. Running the Project:
   To run the project on your local environment, use the following command:

   ```
   npm run serve
   ```

   This command will compile the project and start the development server.

5. Accessing the Website:
   Upon running the 'npm run serve' command, you will see a message containing the local address (e.g., "Local: http://localhost:8080/") in your terminal/command prompt. Copy the address and paste it into your web browser. The Vue.js-powered website should now load successfully.

Remember, the project is using Vue.js, and you can access the different features and functionalities by interacting with the included components (HolidayList, CityHolidayWeather, and RentalList) displayed in the web application.
